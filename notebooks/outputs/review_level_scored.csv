Very sturdy and easy for my kids to hold on to, even my 3 year old. It does add some weight to the iPad but it's functional weight. Meaning it forces you to keep a good grip to hold it. The only gripe I have is that the flip cover which protects the head phone jack doesn't close properly. Not sure what Otter box was doing with this during the R&D process. I would definitely recommend if you have children using your iPad.",4,0.5,ok,7286.048650741577,361
ELECTRONICS_109792,-0.5,6,"IMHO, This charger is a little too picky when it decides that cells are no longer suitable for re-charging. I does a fine job on new cells, but I am glad that I have an older Maha charger that is a bit less ""critical"" and will still recharge useful cells that are several years old. The Sony Nimh cells included  appear to be no longer made in Japan.Update...I have also noticed  a very high self discharge on the cells that came with the charger... I put them in a radio last weekend and played it for a few hours and this weekend when I turned it on the cells were almost dead :( The two year old ""made in Japan"" Sony cells that I still use have lost some capacity, but still perform better than these!I just ordered more Eneloops... no more Sony cells for me!SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries",3,0.0,ok,3367.1979904174805,423

It is not the hub's fault. The USB 3.0 adapter that I put in caused a multitude of problems, and rendered this hub no better than a USB 2.0 hub. I ended up taking them both out of my pc as they caused it to do all sorts of squirrelly things. I went back to ordinary usb 2.0 adapter and hubs.

ELECTRONICS_1466042,-0.75,4,"On paper, this laptop has a lot going for it - a 3rd generation Ivy Bridge i5 dual core processor, 6 GB RAM, a 15.6"" multi touch screen, a 5GHz wifi adapter (Atheros AR5BWB222), 3 USB ports (1 USB 3.0), 5 hour battery life (as per the product specs - in reality this is about half that), and a modern design aesthetic.Unfortunately, the more I used it, the more I ran into its limitations, and hence my 3 star (It's Okay) rating.1. Performance.Its Windows Experience Index numbers (on a scale of 1 to 7.9) are:Processor (6.9), Memory (7.1), Graphics 4.5, Gaming (6.2), Hard disk (5.9)The V5 is really hurt by its anemic Intel HD Graphics 4000 chip (only 128MB of dedicated video memory); as well as by its 5400 RPM hard drive.2. ConstructionThis is a handsome laptop, but its cut corners soon become apparent with use - it feels plastic-ky and less well finished than my other laptops.3. Usability - TouchpadThe touchpad is located too far to the left making left clicks a challenge, has a stiff click action, and tends to lose sensitivity when performing click-drag operations (when closing Modern/Metro apps, touch pad drags were often ignored.)It supports Win8 actions such as invoking the Charm menu, but these were easy to trigger inadvertently yanking me out of my thoughts.4. Usability - KeyboardThe keyboard is firm, full sized, and backlit. However, some keys are simply too small, and the Caps/Num Lock keys provide no indication when active.5. Usability - Touch screenThe touch screen is the perfect complement to Windows 8's Modern/Metro interface, and is natural to use. However, right click and click drag actions were harder to pull off, and I kept resorting to the mouse.Reaching across the keyboard can be an uncomfortable action depending on user position.Touching the screen can also be sacrilegious for those sensitive to screen smudges :)6. ScreenThe display was sufficiently bright, with adequate color reproduction. Its 1366x768 resolution is measly for a 15.6"" screen, but has the benefit of making text easier to read and icons easier to click - since each pixel is larger.7. No built-in Ethernet/VGA portsIn a tragic design decision, these ports are only available using a separate adapter cable. That means I not only have to pack this itty bitty connector each time, but I also have to worry that I will misplace it :(8. Battery life - even with light use, the battery ran down in 3 hours. This is too short for mobile use.9. Integrated Optical Drive - a nice touch, but as expected at this price point, Bluray is not supported.10. SoftwareThis unit was surprisingly clear of bloatware (except for NTI Media Maker). Even the trial Windows Office 2010 is a download link. Unfortunately, Acer was just as sparing with useful software.Who is this for?###########This laptop seems to be aimed at users with light to moderate usage needs - it should be adequate for Internet browsing/streaming, general home use, and for school homework. The larger pixels at this resolution and screen size should also be easier on older eyes.However, gamers, road warriors, developers, and other power users will likely be better served elsewhere.Conclusion#######While this may seem to be a lot of laptop for the money, I found that there were some material compromises.How satisfied you will be with this laptop will depend on which of these compromises matter to you.Happy Computing!",3,0.0,ok,2871.1626529693604,1012
ELECTRONICS_1509607,0.6,5,"My son and i researched and went back and forth between these, beats and bose headphones.  He listens to some rap, but mostly rock and pop.  he spends 2 hours a day sitting on a bus and really hated listening to the other riders music or complaints or just their conversations, the noise isolating effect these have apparently do the trick because since i got these for him i haven't heard a single complaint again... they come with a very durable carrying case that the headphones fold up into.  Being a techie dad i gave them a thorough testing and i really like design choices that were made in the construction. one problem that always seems to pop up with headphones in general is that the connections break and you get a lot of crackling or music popping in and out or only working on one ear.  I suspect that will not easily be a problem with these because of the angle and the durable construction at these points.  if i find out differently from my sons abuse of these i'll update the review.",5,1.0,ok,3069.4968700408936,421
ELECTRONICS_1616261,0.0,4,"I wasn't expecting much from this headset considering other bluetooth headsets I have used suffered from a background hissing noise when listening to music.  I'm pleased to say that these headphones don't suffer from a hiss.I'm impressed by the sound produced by these headphones.  The music sounds crisp.  These headphones are even good for classical music.Pairing it with my Nokia N9 was easy.  The phone instantly recognized the headphones and I only had to click ""connect"" within my phone interface to get the devices paired.Battery life is OK.  I estimate they power lasts about 5 hours, solely listening to music.I can also skip songs, change the volume, and pause the music from the little controls on the wire.  The device speaks in your ear to indicate when the device is turned on, turned off, or if the battery is running low.  The battery warning startles me since all of a sudden, a female voice starts speaking in my ear.  I think a little beep would have been a better warning.  On the other hand, the power on/off alerts are useful.The fit of the headphones is OK, but I wouldn't jog or run with them on as they would likely fall out.  The buds are larger than others I have used and it took awhile to get used to the way they fit.Despite my quibbles, I think these headphones are an excellent choice if you're looking to get rid of the wire from your phone to the headphones.  My high rating is based on the great sound quality of these headphones in comparison to other bluetooth headphones.",5,1.0,ok,2762.2838020324707,524

ELECTRONICS_1661613,0.5833333333333334,12,"Instructions for set-up and &#34;pairing&#34; with my iPad Air were very easy to understand and complete.  The only thing that I had to do that was not mentioned in the instructions was to turn my iPad off and back on again for it to work.  I am not sure if that should be one of the steps, or that I just had to do it to make it work.  Once I turned by iPad off and back on...it works like a champ!!!The keyboard is set-up nicely, and are nicely spaced even for larger hands.  The backlighting is VERY nice to have.  I cannot wait to travel with it.  The hardcover securely holds my iPad Air.  I was pleasantly surprised that it is not bulky...at all...to carry around.  I actually prefer it to the soft case I purchased when I bought my iPad Air.

ELECTRONICS_257489,0.14285714285714285,7,"I bought this friction mount for my Nuvi 350, and used both on a recent driving vacation.  Both worked even better than expected!Amazon's listings are a little confusing--If you have a Nuvi, don't buy the one that says ""for Garmin GPS"".  Get this one instead.  With this one, you don't need to purchase anything else, just use the little bracket that comes with the Nuvi unit.  (Put the bracket onto the mount without the GPS in it--it takes some pressure or a little twisting to get the bracket to snap onto the ball of the mount.  But once it's on, you won't need to take the bracket off the mount.  The GPS snaps into and out of the bracket easily--the bracket and mount stay together as one piece.)The literature with the GPS unit said that the dash mount adhesive is hard to remove, so I didn't want that on my car's dash.  Some reviews said the windshield mount could melt to the glass and I didn't want that, either.  Also, some say that thieves will break into your car even if they can only see the windshield mount, assuming the GPS is in the car somewhere.  So, I wanted the friction mount.  It was about $28 at amazon.After using it, I like it even better than I thought I would.  It holds VERY well; I never had a problem with it slipping even once.  It's easy to reposition, for example if the sun is hitting it the wrong way, and it's easy to put into the console when you park so that nothing shows to tempt theives.  Also, it can just stay plugged in to the car's power outlet.  The cord plugs into the bracket on the mount instead of directly into the Nuvi, which is convenient.  The Nuvi unit itself easily releases from the mount, with no cords to unplug, and is easy to take with you.The only disadvantages I can come up with are that it is a separate purchase (but is complete), and it's not beautiful (but neither are the other mounts, I guess).If you can't or don't want to use the windshield or permanent dash mounts, try this one.  I'm glad I bought it.A suggestion to amazon would be to describe all these mounts & other accessories a little better--lots of postings say they bought the wrong mount or bought accessories that were already included with the GPS unit, because they were listed on the product page with the GPS unit.By the way, I love the Nuvi 350!",5,1.0,ok,3891.4408683776855,784

ELECTRONICS_391311,-0.6666666666666666,3,"My company recently moved me into an area that could not get noisier.  I would have better luck getting work done at a Kid Rock concert.  Actually, that is what I was doing.  Blasting my music to drowned out all the constant chatter.When I was in the electronic engineering field we had offices. When the door was closed that meant you were in a meeting or deep into your work. Unless it was an emergency, rarely was there a knock. You'd get a polite email asking for you to let them know when you were free.Not so in the software industry.  Now we are all in cube farms with constant racket and chatter.  I got these in hopes that the noise cancellation would allow me to keep the music volume down.  No luck.  The noise cancelation increases the volume a little but does nothing to drowned out the external noises.I know over the ear noise cancellation works best, but wearing glasses does not allow me to use those.The biggest negative though is these things can only be worn for a short time.  The buds are attached to a big plastic knob that pushes against your outer ear canal.  After an hour or two your ear starts hurting.  If you force yourself to continue wearing them after that, you end of with a soar ear the rest of the night.Over all I recommend going with a different brand unless you have really big outer ear canals and don't really mind that the noise cancellation does not work.",1,-1.0,ok,2558.7873458862305,481
ELECTRONICS_405550,0.7857142857142857,14,"Sometimes when you travel there is no USB port on a laptop or AC outlet on a wall that is available to power your electronic devices when their battery charges start running low. This product is perfect for those situations. It is nice and compact, and comes with multiple adaptors to power and/or recharge a wide variety of electronic products. The included adaptors provide a backup for my iPod Touch 2G, iPod Nano 2G, Samsung cell phone, bluetooth headset, Garmin Forerunner 305, and Garmin Nuvi 660.Additional adaptors for other gadgets(such as for the Amazon Kindle) are available at a modest price.Here are a few comments to keep in mind:1. You can charge only one item at a time. Therefore when you reach your destination and have access to an AC outlet, if you wish to charge multiple items simultaneously, this is not the item to do that (I recommend the Callpod, which I have reviewed on Amazon). [But see my April 24, 2010 update below. I figured out a way to do it and no longer use the Callpod.]2. If you have a USB AC adaptor that you use for your iPod Touch or Nano, it will work fine to charge this unit. There is no need to buy a separate adaptor.3. Once the unit is fully charged, you can just leave it plugged in to the charging source (I checked with Tekkeon tech support, which is very helpful and responds quickly). That way you can be sure that the unit will always have a full charge when you need it.4. This unit will not power a laptop or comparable electronic product. But Tekkeon does sell more powerful (and more expensive) units that will do so.5. I chose this unit rather than the less expensive MP 1550, which runs on AA or rechargeable batteries, because in my experience I have found that a power source with its own internal battery lasts longer than one relying on batteries. Of course, the flip side is that once this unit runs out of power, you can't just pop some fresh batteries in. However, that is not an issue for me, though something that you may want to consider.This product looks nice, is simple to operate, and does what it says. I am very happy with it.Update August 22, 2009: I like this so much that I use it at home on a daily basis. The unit has two USB ports--a mini and a regular. Using the included retractable cable, I plug one end into the mini on the unit and the other end (which has a regular USB) into an Apple travel charger that is plugged into the wall. That way this unit is always at full charge if I take it on a trip. I use the free regular USB port on the unit to charge a variety of devices (though one at a time) that come with a USB cable, such as my BlackBerry and iPod Touch [But see April 24 update below re how to charge more than one at a time]. It is more convenient for me to charge them on this unit than to plug them into my laptop (which I do only when I need to sync data).I have also found the built in flashlight on this unit a nice feature to have when rummaging through my bags looking for some gizmo that I can't find.Update November 24, 2009: I recently stayed in a very nice hotel where the bedroom was really dark at night, but there was no nightlight in the bathroom. Solution: I just turned the flashlight on this unit on all night (8 hours)in the bathroom. Not only did the light last through the night, but it took only a relatively short time (less than 20 minutes) to restore the unit to a full charge.Update April 16, 2010: Customer service for this company is first rate. On a recent trip I realized that I did not have a micro USB tip that would fit my BlackBerry Tour and Kindle 2. I emailed customer service after I returned home, and was advised that this tip was supposed to be included with the product. But since I bought my unit over a year ago, it was not included then. When I explained the situation to Jerry at customer service, he mailed me the tip at no cost within 24 hours. It's always nice to know that a quality product comes with quality customer service.Update April 24, 2010: If you would like to use this product to simultaneously power more than one USB device at a time, there is an easy way to do it. I use the Belkin mini USB 2.0 hub (which I have reviewed on Amazon) and plug it into this unit, and now have four USB ports for my gadgets. The more gadgets you plug in, the faster you will drain the unit. But it is handy, for example, on a longer plane ride or at the beach for my wife and me to each plug our Slacker G2 players into the hub, which is in turn connected to the MP 1800, in order to extend the playing time. I also use the same technique for my Kindle 2, BlackBerry Tour, iPod Touch, and Garmin Forerunner 405CX.Also, when you arrive at your destination, just connect this unit to an AC adaptor as I described in an earlier comment above, connect the hub to this unit, and now with AC power you can simultaneously not only recharge this unit, but also recharge up to four USB devices--all without a computer or bringing along the separate USB adaptors for each device (though being a ""belts & suspenders"" kind of guy, I still bring them along just in case for some reason the hub should fail since ""Murphy's law""--if something can go wrong, it will go wrong--has kicked in on more than one vacation). Note: What I have described only works with the type of relatively low power draw USB devices that I have mentioned above. Also if you are drawing too much power for all the devices connected, the light will flash on the Belkin mini hub and/or on the Tekkeon MP1800. If that happens, just disconnect one or more devices until the flashing stops.Update September 11, 2011: Due to Hurricane Irene, the area in which we live was flooded and my wife and I were trapped in the house for 24 hours until the flood waters receded. We lost all power, and to my dismay the corded land line phone had gone dead. That left me with only my BlackBerry to communicate with friends and family.Power was not restored until four days later, but in the interim I had to return home during the day to supervise flood restoration crews and other persons. Each night I charged the Tekkeon at our friends' house, and brought it with me to my home during the day so I could keep my BlackBerry charged to make and receive calls and email. It worked like a champ.Bottom line: In emergency conditions, this unit proved critical and performed flawlessly.Update July 24, 2012: The unit recently ""died."" When I plug it in to charge, the green light goes on and the flashlight works, but the second I disconnect it from the USB charging source, the green light goes off and nothing works. Customer service said it could be a defective switch, but I am well beyond the one year warranty period. However, I may continue to bring this as a nightlight when I travel since the flashlight will work so long as the unit is connected to a power source.Update August 7, 2012: I now use the Powergen mobile juice pack 5200, which I have reviewed on Amazon, and like it even better than this unit.",5,1.0,ok,6596.437454223633,1994
ELECTRONICS_530397,-0.5,2,"Short story: with another 3' cable, will not charge phone fast, results in a slow charge.I bought these along with a 3ft Male to Micro USB 2.0 AmazonBasics cable.  The idea was to charge my phone with them.  My micro connectors tend to break/wear out so I thought an extension would work well.  (aka just buy the smaller cable to replace rather than the long cable)The two combined when plugged into my stock Moto X wall plug is a slow charge. If I take the smaller 3ft cable and plug it directly into the charger I get a fast charge.I've done some reading online and the consensus is that the extension cables are NOT GOOD for charging.  The act of extending (connecting the two cables) introduces resistance to the line and thus they slow the power that can flow to the device.I would have been smarter to buy two 12ft cables from another well known cable website for the same money.

ELECTRONICS_658974,0.628125,16,"I am not a music buff and I am not an expert on sounds, but as an average Joe, I enjoy and appreciate good audio from my headphones. And this Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone delivers it!1. THE SOUND: The audio quality is excellent. The enclosed headphone captures the all types of sound very well. I was able to hear all the background vocals, instruments, noises, and subtleties with ease. The digital sound is crisp and clear. Immensely enjoyable.2. THE WIRELESS: When it comes to the wireless capacity, each user might have different experience since it depends on your home. I live in ~1900 square feet (2 floors, attached garage) home. I was able hear the sound WHILE moving around the house (everywhere) without any drop in the sound. So when I was doing chores in the house (moving around floor to floor), I was able to enjoy the music without any drops. HOWEVER, when I was outside of the house, the sound was fine ONLY when I was still, but when I walked around outside of the house, the sound dropped frequently. If you want to use it outside, then you need to move the transmitter (and the music device) outside of your home and connect it to the outside outlet.3. THE HEADPHONE: It is comfortable, adjustable, but bit heavy (it has 2 AAA rechargeable batteries  - 1 on each side). So you need to get used to it. It has power, volume, dynamic bass boost, and 3D surround buttons on the right side of the headphone - which are small buttons, but great option. Since it covers your ears, it may cause you to sweat a little if you move around.4. THE TRANSMITTER: The transmitter comes with many options (power plug accessories for international usage) and cables for different electronic devices (TV, iPod, CD & Radio Player, etc). There is NO battery option for the transmitter. It needs to be plugged to the outlet all the time to be used. Also, the transmitter is used as rechargeable station for your headphone (the headphone has 2 AAA rechargeable battery on each side), which is an excellent idea. Also note that when you use the headphone - you MUST power on the transmitter AND the headphone each time you use it. There is no auto-power on.Overall, I LOVE this product - yes, it is a bit pricey, but it is a quality built and can be used with many electronic devices in the home. My wife loves it, when I go to bed she puts the wireless headphone on and watches TV from the bed - enjoying its undisturbed sound without disturbing me!

ELECTRONICS_716537,-1.0,9,"I wish Logitech would get some decent Mac programmers. Honestly. I've used a number of keyboard/mouse combinations over the years from them because they make the nicest feeling peripherals in the price range, but their Mac support sucks. They install a crappy control panel, make you restart, settings don't stick between reboots and half the time the peripherals aren't recognized by the software.Take this KB/mouse combo, for example. I downloaded latest Logitech Control Center this morning (3.3.0) and I'm running OS X 10.6.4. I installed and restarted and the keyboard still isn't recognized by the software so I can configure it properly. The most basic thing they could have possibly done - remapping the cmd and option keys so they are in the right places - doesn't even get done. And there's no way to change it in the settings. As I've said, I've used many Logitech keyboards in the past so I usually just remap them manually using the Keyboard pref pane. That *doesn't work with this device* because of the newfangled USB Unity thing. I can't remap the keys at all. Worse, trying to remap them kills the mouse button mappings (switching the CMD and option keys in the Keyboard pref pane also does it for the custom mappings on the mouse). I don't know who's fault this is - Apple's or Logitech's - but I don't care. The KB/mouse is nigh on unusable in OS X.The only reason it gets 3 stars is because it works well in Windows.
